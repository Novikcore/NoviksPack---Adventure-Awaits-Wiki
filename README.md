# 🧙 Magic Systems

Magic in **NoviksPack – Adventure Awaits** is designed to **support and enhance combat**, not replace it.

Spells provide mobility, control, burst damage, and utility that synergize with melee, artifacts, and exploration rather than acting as a stand‑alone progression path.

---

## 🧠 Magic Philosophy

- Magic is **optional**, but powerful
- Spells reward planning and positioning
- Mana management matters

You can complete the pack without magic — but mastery makes progression smoother.
