This guide will help you survive your first days and understand what makes this pack different.

---

## ⚠️ Read This First

- Combat is **skill-based** and **dangerous**
- Running in unprepared will get you killed
- Exploration is rewarding, but preparation is essential
- Loot and artifacts are the primary form of progression

If you treat this like vanilla survival, you *will* struggle.

---

## 🌱 First Spawn Checklist

When you first enter the world:

✅ Check your **keybinds**  
✅ Look for **starter structures or villages**  
✅ Avoid large dungeons early  
✅ Craft basic gear **before** exploring

---

## 🪵 Day One Survival Tips

### ✅ Gather Essentials
Start with:

- A **shield** (very important)
- Basic armor as soon as possible

Mods like **Farmer’s Delight** and **Aquaculture 2** make food easier and more rewarding early on.

---

### ⚔️ Learn the New Combat
This pack uses **Epic Fight** and **Better Combat**, which means:

- Weapons have **attack animations**
- Timing and positioning matter
- Button-mashing will get you killed
- Some weapons have special attacks or combos

📌 **Important:**

➡️ See: **Combat Changes & Controls**

---

## 🏠 Establish a Safe Base Early

Before heavy exploration:
- Build or claim a safe base
- Light the area well
- Store extra gear
- Prepare backup weapons

Waystones will become important later, but early safety matters more.

---

## 🗺️ Exploration: What to Do (and What to Avoid)

### ✅ Good Early Exploration
- Small surface structures
- Villages and camps
- Light ruins and towers
- Overworld biomes

### ❌ Avoid Early On

- Gateways
- Deep underground structures
- Boss arenas

Many structures scale in difficulty faster than vanilla Minecraft.

## 🎒 Loot, Artifacts & Death

### ☠️ Death Is Part of Progression
You *will* die — this is expected.

Thanks to **Corpse**, your items will:
- Be stored safely where you died
- Not despawn
- Be recoverable once you return

📌 Always prepare before long trips.

---

---

---
